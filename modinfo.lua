A CAM!? FOR FREE!?

This mod allows you to switch between your regular Don't Starve camera and a free fly camera with no restrictions on where you can or can't go!

The default camera toggle keybind is '=' but this can be changed inside the games settings (NOT MOD CONFIGURATIONS, the actual game settings).

This mod does not support controllers, yet...
